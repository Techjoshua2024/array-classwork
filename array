#These are the steps below 

 1:Break the array into two parts:

The part from the start to the position we want to rotate.
The part from that position to the end.

2:Rejoin these parts in reverse order:

The part from the position to the end comes first.
The part from the start to the position goes to the end.


This is the code below: 


def rotLeft(a, d):
    # Step 1: Get the number of elements in the array
    n = len(a)
    
    # Step 2: If we need to rotate more times than the array length,
    # we can simplify this by rotating only the remainder (modulus operation)
    d = d % n
    
    # Step 3: Create two parts of the array
    # Part 1: from d to the end of the array
    # Part 2: from the start of the array to d
    part1 = a[d:]  # from d to the end
    part2 = a[:d]  # from the start to d
    
    # Step 4: Join the two parts together in the new order
    rotated_array = part1 + part2
    
    return rotated_array

# Example usage
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
d = 4
print(rotLeft(a, d))  # Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
